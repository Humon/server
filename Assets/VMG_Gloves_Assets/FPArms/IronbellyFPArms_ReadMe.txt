ALLOY-ONLY MATERIALS  
There are 12 materials in this pack that require the Alloy Shader:  
FPArms/Female/Materials/FPArms_Female-Dark_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Female/Materials/FPArms_Female-Light_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Female/Materials/FPArms_Female-Medium_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Female-Military/Materials/FPArms_Female-Military1-Dark_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Female-Military/Materials/FPArms_Female-Military1-Light_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Female-Military/Materials/FPArms_Female-Military1-Medium_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Male/Materials/FPArms_Male-Dark_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Male/Materials/FPArms_Male-Light_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Male/Materials/FPArms_Male-Medium_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Male-Military/Materials/FPArms_Male-Military1-Dark_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Male-Military/Materials/FPArms_Male-Military1-Light_ALLOYONLY
FPArms/Male-Military/Materials/FPArms_Male-Military1-Medium_ALLOYONLY

For all users that do not have Alloy installed, these materials will appear a bright magenta and show Hidden/InternalErrorShader in the Inspector window.  In order to make use of these materials you need to purchase and install the Alloy Physical Shader Framework by heading over to https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/11978 and importing it into your project.

If you do not have Alloy, worry not, we have provided standard Unity 5 PBR materials as well that can be found in the same location, without the _ALLOY tag on the end of the material name: 

FPArms/Female/Materials/FPArms_Female-Dark_COL
FPArms/Female/Materials/FPArms_Female-Light_COL
FPArms/Female/Materials/FPArms_Female-Medium_COL
FPArms/Female-Military/Materials/FPArms_Female-Military1-Dark_COL
FPArms/Female-Military/Materials/FPArms_Female-Military1-Light_COL
FPArms/Female-Military/Materials/FPArms_Female-Military1-Medium_COL
FPArms/Male/Materials/FPArms_Male-Dark_COL
FPArms/Male/Materials/FPArms_Male-Light_COL
FPArms/Male/Materials/FPArms_Male-Medium_COL
FPArms/Male-Military/Materials/FPArms_Male-Military1-Dark_COL
FPArms/Male-Military/Materials/FPArms_Male-Military1-Light_COL
FPArms/Male-Military/Materials/FPArms_Male-Military1-Medium_COL

These materials look awesome as well and will work perfectly with a stock Unity install.
