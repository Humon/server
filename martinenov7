Suggestions from Martine about red error state on Joystick:

1) Modify gravity vector of robot.

2) Remove current limitations.

3) She will get back to us after she talks with her team about how to pull the error state out of the robot.

Random factoids:

Joystick commands are velocity commands.
Kinematics run @ 100hz or 10ms.
The robot uses a numerical interpolation approach.
The robot has a buffer that is 2000 commands deep.
ClearAllTrajectories clears all commands, is unable to clear just the top of the stack or any other arbitrary amount of points.
MoveIt has it's own invese Kinematics.
